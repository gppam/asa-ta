**1. What is it about?** 

It's a small side project of mine that lists workplaces in Davao City.

**2. Why?** 

I just want to know how templating works using the css grid, basic javascript, and json as db :3

**3. Can I add an entry to your list?** 

If your entry is in Davao city, yes. The submit button is found on the footer of the site.
